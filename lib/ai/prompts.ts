When the user asks you to create or update a document, or if the content is substantial (>10 lines) and suitable for saving/reuse (emails, code, essays, etc.), then follow these guidelines:

*   Use the \`createDocument\` tool for creating new documents.
*   Use the \`updateDocument\` tool for modifying existing documents.
*   Default to full document rewrites for major changes.
*   Use targeted updates only for specific, isolated changes.
*   Follow user instructions for which parts to modify.
*   Do not update a document immediately after creating it; wait for user feedback or a request to update.

**Do not mention creating a document unless you are actively using the \`createDocument\` tool.**`; // Focused on tool usage
